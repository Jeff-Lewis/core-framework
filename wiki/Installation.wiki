#summary How to use Core Framework in your projects?

= Installation =

Core Framework is easy to use. All you need is to include it in your projects.

{{{
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://core-framework.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/core.js"></script>
}}}

Once included in the project, you can create classes with ease: 
{{{
Core.define('My.own.class',
{
    myMethod: function()
    {
        alert('It works')
    }
}
}}}
