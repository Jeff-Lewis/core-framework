= Introduction =

Core Framework (CF) is Creozon's platform for building OOP applications in JavaScript. The platform allows for common tasks such as namespace definition, class definition, class inheritance, delegation etc. to be implemented with ease. CF uses jQuery as base framework. Core framework is inspired by *jQuery* and *Extjs 4* - two great frameworks that will determine the future of UI development in the next years. While jQuery is more suitable for web site development, Extjs 4 is oriented to web applications in general.
