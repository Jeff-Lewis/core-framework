#summary Ajax File Upload with CF

= File upload =

Most of the user interaction in rich UI's happens on screen without refreshing the page. File upload with JavaScript can be painful process in terms of crossbrowser issues. CF provides file upload interface to simplify this process. There are also handy callback functions i.e listeners which can be used to track the upload status.

= Uploading file with CF =

The next example shows how to upload file with CF:

  * Assume there is a form defined with action *upload.php*
  * Assume there is a container defined with class *.ajaxUpload*

{{{
var upload = new Core.data.FileUpload(
{
	listeners: 
	{
		before: function(event, ui)
		{
                },
		success: function(event, response)
		{
                }
         },
         renderTo: '.ajaxUpload'
         
});
			
/* Render upload */
upload.render();
}}}

The example above will render a file upload field in the container with class *.ajaxUpload* and will post data to *upload.php* via AJAX call.
